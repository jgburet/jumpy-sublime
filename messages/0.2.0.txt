Jumpy now allows you to customize where labels are placed and how they look like.  

Two entries are available for change: `jumpy.label_css` and `jumpy.regex`.  
Go to `Preferences > Settings` and set them to your preference.  

Jumpy also handles syntax specific configurations (`Preferences > Settings - Syntax Specific`). This means that it can behave differently between two files, even if they are opened & visible in the same window.  
This comes handy where the Regex used does not suits perfectly your syntax. For example, you might enhance it so `kebab-cased` CSS properties are not identified as several words.  

Example:
```json
"jumpy.label_css": "background-color: color(var(--redish) min-contrast(var(--background) 2.5)); font-size: 0.7rem;",
"jumpy.regex": "\\w+",
```
Note here the regex is escaped.
